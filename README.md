[00:06.38] I don't want a lot for Christmas
[00:12.73] There is just one thing I need
[00:17.26] I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
[00:24.30] I just want you for my own
[00:28.57] More than you could ever know
[00:33.38] Make my wish come true
[00:38.71] All I want for Christmas is you
[00:45.57] Yeah
[00:47.57] 
[00:57.00] I don't want a lot for Christmas
[01:00.25] There is just one thing I need (and I)
[01:03.94] Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
[01:09.75] I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
[01:16.58] Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
[01:46.08] 
[01:22.57] I just want you for my own
[01:25.64] More than you could ever know
[01:28.97] Make my wish come true
[01:32.27] All I want for Christmas is you
[01:38.58] You, baby
[01:43.08] 
[01:41.13] Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
[01:44.93] I won't even wish for snow (and I)
[01:48.48] I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
[01:54.76] I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
[02:01.42] I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
[02:30.42] 
[02:07.17] 'Cause I just want you here tonight
[02:10.52] Holding on to me so tight
[02:13.66] What more can I do?
[02:16.41] Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
[02:23.37] You, baby
[02:27.87] 
[02:29.53] Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
[02:33.56] And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
[02:40.16] And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
[02:43.12] I hear those sleigh bells ringing
[02:45.69] Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
[02:48.43] Won't you please bring my baby to me?
[03:06.93] 
[02:51.62] Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
[02:55.27] This is all I'm asking for
[03:01.52] I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
[03:29.02] 
[03:04.53] Oh, I just want you for my own
[03:07.94] More than you could ever know
[03:11.13] Make my wish come true
[03:13.89] Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
[03:21.19] You, baby
[03:25.69] 
[03:27.19] All I want for Christmas is you, baby
[03:33.56] All I want for Christmas is you, baby
[03:39.96] All I want for Christmas is you, baby
[03:46.33] All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
[03:52.74] All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
