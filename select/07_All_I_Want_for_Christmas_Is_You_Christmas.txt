I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about those presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas is you

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow, and
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Boy, what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas is you

And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
When the sounds of children
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
To the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want
For Christmas is you
