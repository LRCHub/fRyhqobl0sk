I-I-I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own (ooh, ooh, ooh)
More than you could ever know (oh, oh, oh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just going to keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (I)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Oh, oh, oh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh)
And everyone is singing (Oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Yeah, oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?, yeah

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own (ooh)
More than you could ever know (oh, oh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is...

You
You, baby all I want for Christmas is you, baby
You
All, all, all, all I want for Christmas is you, baby
You
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
